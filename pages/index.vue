            I am a professional software developer of 11+ years. I am good at many things but
            especially experienced in web, real-time (games), networking, and writing maintainable code. I have
            professional experience with C++, Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Groovy, C#, and Go. In my
            free time I do Go web apps, games in Unity, and I developed an Android app using gRPC.
